export const aboutDescription = [
`
I am a graphic designer and front-end developer. 
I'm avid about interactive, accessible, and clean 
web design. I've spent the past 9 years working across multiple 
areas of print & digital design. With this experience, I am able 
to provide creative insight for your next project.
 
`,`
These days, I spend my time researching, designing, 
and coding. You may also catch me learning a new board game, 
hiking, or solving an escape room.
`,
`
Iâ€™m currently looking for a new role where I can collaborate 
with other passionate individuals to build exciting product experiences. 
I look forward to bringing my creative insight and experience to your team!
