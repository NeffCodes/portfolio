`
With over 9 years working across different areas of print & 
digital design, I am able to provide a creative insight to your next 
project. 
`,`
These days, I have been spending my time researching, designing and 
coding, although you may catch me learning a new board game with 
friends, trying out an escape room, or hiking on the trails. 
`,`
Currently, I'm looking for the next challenge to apply my skills to, 
so if you're interested let me know!
