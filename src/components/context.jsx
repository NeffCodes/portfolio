`
I've spent the past 9 years working across multiple areas 
of print & digital design. I am able to provide a creative insight 
to your next project, and I'm looking for the next challenge 
to apply my skills to.
 
`,`
These days, I have been spending my time researching, designing and 
coding. You may also catch me learning a new board game with 
friends, hiking, or trying out an escape room.
