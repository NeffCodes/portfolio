This project is a portfolio peice through [Codecademy's](https://codecademy.com) Front-End Engineer course. The goal of the project was to design, develop, and document a website that displays minimal content provided by [Reddit's](https://www.reddit.com) client using React & Redux but does not allow for any contribution.
