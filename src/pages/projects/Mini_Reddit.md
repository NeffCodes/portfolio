## Challenge

This project is a portfolio piece through [Codecademy's](https://codecademy.com) Front-End Engineer course. The goal of the project was to design, develop, and document a website that displays minimal content provided by [Reddit's](https://www.reddit.com) API using React & Redux but does not allow for any contribution. The application allows users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.  

Project Requirements:

+ Build the application using React and Redux
+ Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
+ Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)
+ Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app
+ Users can search the data using terms
+ Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined
+ Get 90+ scores on Lighthouse (with the exception of Performance if it is related to the media assets provided from Reddit)

## Approach

Like most of my projects, I started this project on pen and paper, writing out the sitemap and rough sketching different layouts. Once I had a fairly good idea on how I wanted it to look, I hopped they layout over to Figma and started working on the scheme. Once I had the scheme roughly where I wanted it, and a good visual target of how I wanted the site to look, I started the actual coding, building each component and updating my store as I went.  

After I built out the site to the specified requirements, I started to fiddle around to add in a couple features that I thought would be more useful, like seeing replies to the comments. Once I had the functionality in, I went back and adjusted the styling to make it look cleaner.  

## Afterwards

Although the project is completed in regards to the provided requirements, there are many things that I plan on continueing working on (afterall, no project is ever done, right?). I am still not 100% in love with my color scheme, and there are a couple features that I want to add later. So keep an eye out in the future!
