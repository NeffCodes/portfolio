## Challenge

While as marketing director, my team was tasked with providing a new website design to replace the previous. The new site needed to allow users to filter and search through the database of properties available, a portal that allowed customers to make payments, and assist the customer in process stages of leasing a property.

## Process

In the first stages of the site, my team and I sat with a couple of the sales teams to get a feel of what they would like and needed from the site. Once we got that data, we worked on laying out the content and general flow for the site. This included creating some media content to be included in the site. Throughout the process, we gave presentations to the owners and department heads, and also conferred with members from the development team to make sure we stayed within their scope.

## Afterwards

Once the design was finalized, we provided the design specs to the IT department who handled the task of developing and maintianing the site.
