## Challenge

While as marketing director, my team was tasked with providing a new website design. The new site needed to allow users to filter and search through the database of properties available, assist the users through the stages of leasing a property, and provide a portal for making payments.

## Process

For the first stage of the design process, my team and I sat with a couple of the sales teams to get a feel for what they would like and needed from the site. Once we got that data, we worked on laying out the content and general flow for the site. This included creating some media content to be included in the site. Throughout the process, we gave presentations to the owners and department heads, and also conferred with members from the development team to make sure we stayed within their scope.

## Results

Once the design was finalized, we provided the design specs to the IT department who handled the task of developing and maintaining the site.
