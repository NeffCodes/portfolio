## Challenge

When Index-Journal switched content management systems, we had an opportunity to completely revamp and overhaul the website.  

## Process

I was tasked with researching other popular news sites at the time and then coming up with the overall layout and design for how the new site would be. I worked with the news and advertisement department heads on their requirements and presented a couple of different options on how the site could look / flow. Once a final decision was made, I provided the design to the designers at the new CMS, working with them to achieve the look that was chosen.  

## Results

After the new site launched, I was tasked with updating different sections of the site, to fit whatever the needs were or to address any issues that arose. The site went on to win 3rd place in SC Associated Press' Overall Website Layout three years in a row.
